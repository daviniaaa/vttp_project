It ends around 5pm so best to come early before you appointment.\n\nThe swing and the preparation lasts around 5-10 minutes so it'll be over before you know it.

My favorite attraction was Rainbow Reef!\n\nThe staffs were extremely nice and attentive. They let us finish the lap around the lazy river when it’s past their closing time.\n\nRecently, they made some changes to the express pass where they capped the number of times you can go on a ride as express. Definitely not as worth it as before!\n\nPrices for entry was reasonable. Food and refreshments are available but at theme park prices. Do have a hearty breakfast before coming as re-entry is not possible.\n\nLockers are available as well but it was rather pricey.\n\nLastly, Splashworks was closed (i think due to manpower issue)",

Visitors may notice its unconventional symmetry and the inclusion of classic Western designs alongside Moorish details, which set it apart from other mosques. Besides being gazetted as a national monument in 1979, it was also awarded the\nArchitectural Heritage Award from Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in 2003 to recognise its efforts in innovative restoration and conservation works.",

They explained that they’re part of the Malay heritage centre and gave us a brief history of this place which already exceeded our expectations from minute 1! If all historic museums in the world were like this, it’d make visiting every single country a bucket list. SO WORTH IT, I cannot stop telling this to all my friends.

They explained that they’re part of the Malay heritage centre and gave us a brief history of this place which already exceeded our expectations from minute 1! If all historic museums in the world were like this, it’d make visiting every single country a bucket list. SO WORTH IT, I cannot stop telling this to all my friends. We were a group of 7 and the staffs were as equally excited for us as we were and that alone made the experience 10x better!!!",

My favorite attraction was Rainbow Reef!\n\nThe staffs were extremely nice and attentive. They let us finish the lap around the lazy river when it’s past their closing time.\n\nRecently, they made some changes to the express pass where they capped the number of times you can go on a ride as express. Definitely not as worth it as before!\n\nPrices for entry was reasonable. Food and refreshments are available but at theme park prices. Do have a hearty breakfast before coming as re-entry is not possible.\n\nLockers are available as well but it was rather pricey.\n\nLastly, Splashworks was closed (i think due to manpower issue)",
